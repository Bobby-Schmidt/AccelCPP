//  Assignment:
//      Write a program that will keep track of grades for several students at once.
//          Program could keep two vectors in sync: first should hold students' names,
//          second the final grades that can be computed as input is read.
//      Assume fixed number of homework grades.
//
//      NOTE: Currently does not check if proper number of grades/students were entered.
